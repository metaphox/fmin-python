fmin.py
=======

fmin function accepts a range and a function pointer, and finds out the
input on that range which gives out the minimal output.

This is an almost one-to-one translation of the Java version
([Fmin.java](http://www1.fpl.fs.fed.us/Fmin.java), yes, from 1998.)
which itself is translated from the FORTRAN version.

It's pretty meaningless I know, but why not.

    This software was translated from the FORTRAN version
    to Java by a US government employee on official time.  
    Thus this software is also in the public domain.
